.SH NAME
vconsole - virtual machine console
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vconsole [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vconsole
is a virtual machine console, with a strong focus on guests using
a serial console.  Features a tabbed GUI, one tab for the VM list,
then one per guest console.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -c <uri>
Specify libvirt URI to use.
.TP
.B -h
Display help text.
.TP
.B -d
Enable debug logging on stderr.
.SH GETTING STARTED
Just start vconsole.  It comes up with a GUI which should be mostly
self-explanatory.  If you have LIBVIRT_DEFAULT_URI or
VIRSH_DEFAULT_CONNECT_URI set it should pick it up automatically.  If
it comes up empty try passing the libvirt uri using the '-c' switch or
use the "File / Connect ..." menu entry to connect.
.P
Hit 'Enter' on a host line to expland/collapse the guest list.
Hit 'Enter' on a guest line to open a guest (text) console tab for it.
.P
Guest console tabs stay open until you explicitly close them using the
'close tab' file menu entry.  When a guest starts the console will be
(re-)connected automatically.
.P
Typing into a guest console for a guest not running will start it
(this is probably temporary until we have more fancy gui controls for
that).
