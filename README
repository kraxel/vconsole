What is vconsole
================

This is a virtual machine console, with a strong focus on guests using
a serial console.  Features a tabbed GUI, one tab for the VM list,
then one per guest console.  It build on top of libvirt.


Using vconsole
==============

Just start it.  It comes up with a GUI which should be mostly
self-explanatory.  If you have VIRSH_DEFAULT_CONNECT_URI set it should
pick it up automatically.  If it comes up empty try passing the
libvirt uri using the '-c' switch.

Hit 'Enter' on a host line to expland/collapse the guest list.
Hit 'Enter' on a guest line to open a guest (text) console tab for it.

Guest console tabs stay open until you explicitly close them using the
'close tab' file menu entry.  When a guest starts the console will be
(re-)connected automatically.

Typing into a guest console for a guest not running will start it
(this is probably temporary until we have more fancy gui controls for
that).


Known issues / TODO list
========================

vconsole doesn't handle undefining domains yet.

vconsole doesn't handle connection drops (caused by libvirtd restart
for example) yet.

vconsole lacks a .desktop file and manual page.

Most likely there are bugs not listed here.
